# Vocalyze: Simplifying Banking Applications with Conversational AI 🚀

## 💡 Inspiration

Complex financial applications create confusion and frustration, leading users to abandon forms or incorrectly complete them. Traditional banking customer support is overwhelmed, especially by repetitive credit and loan inquiries. It's time to streamline and humanize this process.

That's why I built **Vocalyze**—a real-time, conversational AI assistant designed to analyze and automate credit and loan applications through seamless phone conversations.
